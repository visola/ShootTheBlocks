# ShootTheBlocks

This is a very simple example using [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
and [Physijs](https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs) to build a shoot-a-pile-of-blocks type of game.

I wrote this to learn how both frameworks work and also to experience what is like to write a game 
(even the simplest one like this).

This is how it looks like:

Some of the things I've used in this code that you may think is useful:

1. [Directional light](https://github.com/visola/ShootTheBlocks/blob/master/js/objects/light.js) with shadows
1. [Control the direction](https://github.com/visola/ShootTheBlocks/blob/master/js/controls/bullet.js) of the shooting using the keyboard
1. [Control the camera](https://github.com/visola/ShootTheBlocks/blob/master/js/controls/camera.js) using the mouse
